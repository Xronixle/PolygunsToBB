A list of Polyguns maps converted to be playable on Bad Business.

NOTE: I decided to take some liberties and remove most of the incredibly low detail stuff from some maps that I created. Things like shrubs and water plants are not going to be seen on these.
It should also be noted that spawnpoints are not meant to be based off of the original game, I just took 4 spots that reminded me of possible map spawnpoints and put spawns there.
On top of that, spawns might not be suited well for competitive play; these are meant to be for casual matches between friends trying to share nostalgia or be prepped for the Polyguns integration.


Other Polyguns maps not listed here were already converted by sopranoguitar a few years ago. Check their repo for ones that aren't here. https://github.com/sopranoguitar/BB
