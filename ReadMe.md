# PolygunsToBB
A list of serialized [POLYGUNS](<https://www.roblox.com/games/388599755/>) maps intended to be imported into [Bad Business](<https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/>)'s private server command line.

Feel free to join the [Bad Business Discord](<https://discord.gg/badbusiness>) if you need help with map importing in general.

# How to import the maps:
1. Create a free private server for Bad Business.
2. Join the game and hit F9 to open your command box/line.
3. Find on this repo the map that you want to import and get the raw data link.
4. Copy the raw link
5. In the command line, input "admin_import" followed by a space and then the raw link.
6. Wait for the map to possibly load
7. Enjoy!


# NOTES:
- Occasionally, maps will not load properly due to the size of the map's data. This sadly can only be fixed via restarting the server (Shutting it down and then rejoining) due to ruddev not having the importing function run in multiple threads.
- In order to hopefully have faster load times, I purposely removed some smaller details from maps. These were mainly just small grass shrubs or other minor details that probably don't look very off-putting.


# Some polyguns maps aren't included!
Other Polyguns maps not listed here were already converted by [sopranoguitar](https://github.com/sopranoguitar) a few years ago. You can find the other maps [here](<https://github.com/sopranoguitar/BB>).
